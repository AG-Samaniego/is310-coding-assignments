Clue 1: Summer 2019

It is summer 2019. The season has gifted you with fire opal skies,
and an unquenchable wanderlust.

Driving through the country roads, there was a song that would play in
the car-- The album cover has a man, the night sky, and a moon.

ACTION: Choose the door that corresponds to the right song:
Door 1: "Big Black Car"
Door 2: "Ho Hey" 
Door 3: "Broke"
