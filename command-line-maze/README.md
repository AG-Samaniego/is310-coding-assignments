## Music Maze - A.G. Samaniego

This maze will take you through various playlists and snippets of its associated memories, from 2019 to 2024. 

The objective is to use the playlist screenshots provided in each directory, and choose the right door to make it back to the present day!

Tips:
- Use the command `ls` to view the files and directories available
- Use the command `more [filename]` to read text files
- Use `open [filename]` to open files (helpful with images)
- Some directories may be hidden! Use the command `ls -la` to check for anything hidden!

Good luck and enjoy!
