# GETting Culture Across APIs Homework!
## About
**APIs Used**: Europeana API & MET Museum API
- For this assignment, I chose the Metropolitan Museum of Art API because I know it has a massive collection of artwork and textiles. 

Out of personal curiosity, I took the data for the term "pina" (usually spelled with an enye), a woven textile from the Philippines. While the MET API returned 44 results, the Europeana API only returned 2; it may potentially be because I spelled the query without the neye but regardless, it was a pleasant surprise to find it in its archive.


### Misc History:
Some history: Pina was not traditionally made in the Philippines prior to Spanish colonization, as pineapple was not native to the Philippines. Filipinos have had a long tradition of weaving textiles from various materials, and eventually we adopted the leaves from the Spanish pineapple for use in textile-weaving; for a time, it was traded across parts of the European continent, and was commonly worn within upper casta in colonial Philippines.

Glad to see it was in the Europeana archives-- the textile is just as much part of our colonial history as it is Spain's, and my people certainly never forgot lol.
