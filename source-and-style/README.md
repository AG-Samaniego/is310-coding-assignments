## Pt 1: Inspecting the Web (The Unsent Project)
For this assignment, the website I chose is an artistic project called [The Unsent Project](https://theunsentproject.com/). 

This project was originally started in 2015 by the artist Rora Blue (if you were on Tumblr c. 2012-2018, most people would immediately recognize the name). The concept is simple: What color do you most associate love with? And what was your final, unsent message to your first love?
